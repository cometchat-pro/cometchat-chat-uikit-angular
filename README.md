### Prerequisites
- npm >= 7.
- Angular >= 12.

## Getting Started
To set up Angular Chat UIKit and utilize CometChat for your chat functionality, you'll need to follow these steps:
- Registration: Go to the CometChat website (https://www.cometchat.com/) and sign up for an account.
- Create an App: After registering, log in to your CometChat account and create a new app. Provide the necessary details such as the app name, platform (Angular), and other relevant information. Once you've created the app, CometChat will generate an Auth Key and App ID for you. Make sure to keep these credentials secure, as you'll need them later.
- Make sure you've read the [key concepts](https://www.cometchat.com/docs/angular-uikit-beta/key-concepts)
- Follow the steps provided in the integration section [here](https://www.cometchat.com/docs/angular-uikit-beta/integration#getting-started)

```bash
npm install @cometchat/chat-sdk-javascript@latest @cometchat/uikit-elements@latest @cometchat/uikit-resources@latest @cometchat/uikit-shared@latest
