## About the project
CometChat Angular UIKit provides pre-built user interface kit that developers can use to quickly integrate a reliable & fully featured chat experience into an existing or a new  app.<br />

### Prerequisites

## Getting Started

- Registration: Go to the CometChat website (https://www.cometchat.com/) and sign up for an account.
- Create an App: After registering, log in to your CometChat account and create a new app. Provide the necessary details such as the app name, platform (Angular), and other relevant information. Once you've created the app, CometChat will generate an Auth Key and App ID for you. Make sure to keep these credentials secure, as you'll need them later.
