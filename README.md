## Getting Started

To set up CometChat Angular UI Kit and utilize CometChat for your chat and calls functionality, you'll need to follow these steps:
- Register at the [CometChat Dashboard](https://app.cometchat.com/) to create an account.
- After registering, log into your CometChat account and create a new app. Once created, CometChat will generate an Auth Key and App ID for you. Keep these credentials secure as you'll need them later.
